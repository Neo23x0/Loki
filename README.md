# Loki - Simple IOC and YARA Scanner

Scanner for Simple Indicators of Compromise

Detection is based on four detection methods:

    1. File Name IOC
       Regex match on full file path/name

    2. Yara Rule Check
       Yara signature match on file data and process memory

    3. Hash Check
       Compares known malicious hashes (MD5, SHA1, SHA256) with scanned files
       
    4. C2 Back Connect Check
       Compares process connection endpoints with C2 IOCs (new since version v.10)
       
Additional Checks:

    1. Regin filesystem check (via --reginfs)
    2. Process anomaly check (based on [Sysforensics](http://goo.gl/P99QZQ)
    3. SWF decompressed scan (new since version v0.8)
    4. SAM dump check

The Windows binary is compiled with PyInstaller and should run as x86 application on both x86 and x64 based systems.

## How-To Run LOKI and Analyse the Reports

### Run

  - Download the newest version of LOKI from the [releases](https://github.com/Neo23x0/Loki/releases) section
  - Extract the program package
  - Run loki-upgrader.exe on system with Internet access to retrieve the newest signatures
  - Bring the program folder to a target system that should be scanned: removable media, network share, folder on target system
  - Open a command line "cmd.exe" as Administrator and run it from there (you can also run LOKI without administrative privileges but some checks will be disabled and relevant objects on disk will not be accessible)

### Reports

  - The resulting report will show a GREEN, YELLOW or RED result line.
  - Please analyse the findings yourself by:
    1. uploading non-confidential samples to Virustotal.com
    2. Search the web for the filename
    3. Search the web for keywords from the rule name (e.g. EQUATIONGroupMalware_1 > search for "Equation Group")
    4. Search the web for the MD5 hash of the sample
  - Please report back false positives via the "Issues" section, which is accessible via the right sidebar (mention the false positive indicator like a hash and/or filename and the rule name that triggered)

## Requirements

No requirements if you use the compiled EXE.

If you want to build it yourself:

- [yara](https://github.com/VirusTotal/yara-python/releases) : It's recommended to use the most recent version of the compiled packages for Windows (x86) - Download it from here: https://github.com/VirusTotal/yara-python/releases
- [colorama](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/colorama) : to color it up
- [psutil](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/psutil) : process checks
- [pywin32](http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/) : path conversions (PyInstaller [issue](https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller/issues/1282); Windows only)

## Signature and IOCs

Since version 0.15 the Yara signatures reside in the sub-repository [signature-base](https://github.com/Neo23x0/signature-base). You will not get the sub-repository by downloading the LOKI as ZIP file. It will be included when you clone the repository. 

The IOC files for hashes and filenames are stored in the './signature-base/iocs' folder. All '.yar' files placed in the './signature-base/yara' folder will be initialized together with the rule set that is already included. Use the 'score' value to define the level of the message upon a signature match. 

You can add hash, c2 and filename IOCs by adding files to the './signature-base/iocs' subfolder. All hash IOCs and filename IOC files must be in the format used by LOKI (see the default files). The files must have the strings "hash", "filename" or "c2" in their name to get pulled during initialization.  

For Hash IOCs (divided by newline; hash type is detected automatically)
```
Hash;Description [Reference]
```

For Filename IOCs (divided by newline)
```
# (optional) Description [Reference]
Filename as Regex[;Score as integer[;False-positive as Regex]]
```

# User-Defined Scan Excludes

Since version v0.16.2 LOKI supports the definition of user-defined excludes via "excludes.cfg" in the new "./config" folder. Each line represents a regular expression that gets applied to the full file path during the directory walk. This way you can exclude certain directories regardless of their drive name, file extensions in certain folders and all files and directories that belong to a product that is sensitive to antivirus scanning. 

The '''exclude.cfg''' looks like this:

    # Excluded directories
    #
    # - add directories you want to exclude from the scan
    # - double escape back slashes
    # - values are case-insensitive
    # - remember to use back slashes on Windows and slashes on Linux / Unix / OSX
    # - each line contains a regex that matches somewhere in the full path (case insensitive)
    #   e.g.:
    #   Regex: \\System32\\
    #   Matches C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe
    #
    #   Regex: /var/log/[^/]+\.log
    #   Matches: /var/log/test.log
    #   Not Matches: /var/log/test.gz
    #
    # Excluded by hash
    #
    # - add hash MD5, SHA1 or SHA256 to exclude file from the scan
    #   e.g.:
    #   md5sum:d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e
    #   sha1sum:da39a3ee5e6b4b0d3255bfef95601890afd80709
    #   sha256sum:e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855

# Compile the Scanner

Download [PyInstaller](https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller/releases/), switch to the pyinstaller program directory and execute:

    python ./pyinstaller.py -F C:\path\to\loki.py

This will create a `loki.exe` in the subfolder `./loki/dist`.

## Pro Tip (optional)

To include the msvcr100.dll to improve the target os compatibility change the line in the file `./loki/loki.spec` that contains `a.binaries,` to the following:

    a.binaries + [('msvcr100.dll', 'C:\Windows\System32\msvcr100.dll', 'BINARY')],
    
# Use LOKI on Mac OS X

- Download Yara sources from [here](https://github.com/plusvic/yara/releases/)
- Change to folder ```yara-python``` 
- Run ```python setup.py install```
- Also install the requirement mentioned above by ```sudo pip install colorama```

# Antivirus - False Positives

The compiled scanner may be detected by antivirus engines. This is caused by the fact that the scanner is a compiled python script that implement some file system and process scanning features that are also used in compiled malware code.

If you don't trust the compiled executable, please compile it yourself.
