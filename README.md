# Loki - Simple IOC Scanner

Scanner for Simple Indicators of Compromise

Detection is based on four detection methods:

    1. File Name IOC
       Regex match on full file path/name

    2. Yara Rule Check
       Yara signature match on file data and process memory

    3. Hash check
       Compares known malicious hashes (MD5, SHA1, SHA256) with scanned files
       
    4. C2 Back Connect Check
       Compares process connection endpoints with C2 IOCs (new since version v.10)
       
Additional Checks:

    1. Regin filesystem check (via --reginfs)
    2. Process anomaly check (based on [Sysforensics](http://goo.gl/P99QZQ)
    3. SWF decompressed scan (new since version v0.8)
    4. SAM dump check

The Windows binary is compiled with PyInstaller 2.1 and should run as x86 application on both x86 and x64 based systems.

### Download

Download the latest version of LOKI from the [releases](https://github.com/Neo23x0/Loki/releases) section.

## How-To Run LOKI and Analyse the Reports

### Run

  - Download the latest LOKI version from the [releases](https://github.com/Neo23x0/Loki/releases) section
  - Run it once to retrieve the latest signature base repository
  - Provide the folder to a target system that should be scanned: removable media, network share, folder on target system
  - Right-click on loki.exe and select "Run as Administrator" or open a command line "cmd.exe" as Administrator and run it from there (you can also run LOKI without administrative privileges but some checks will be disabled and relevant objects on disk will not be accessible)

### Reports

  - The resulting report will show a GREEN, YELLOW or RED result line.
  - Please analyse the findings yourself by:
    1. uploading non-confidential samples to Virustotal.com
    2. Search the web for the filename
    3. Search the web for keywords from the rule name (e.g. EQUATIONGroupMalware_1 > search for "Equation Group")
    4. Search the web for the MD5 hash of the sample
  - Please report back false positives via the "Issues" section, which is accessible via the right sidebar (mention the false positive indicator like a hash and/or filename and the rule name that triggered)

## Included IOCs

Loki currently includes the following IOCs:

  - Equation Group Malware (Hashes, Yara Rules [by Kaspersky](http://securelist.com/blog/research/68750/equation-the-death-star-of-malware-galaxy/) and [10 custom rules](http://pastebin.com/P0Fb9DPb) generated by us)
  - Carbanak APT - [Kaspersky Report](http://securelist.com/blog/research/68732/the-great-bank-robbery-the-carbanak-apt/) (Hashes, Filename IOCs - no service detection and Yara rules)
  - Arid Viper APT - [Trendmicro](http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/arid-viper-gaza-vs-israel-cyber-conflict/) (Hashes)

  - Numerous suspicious file name regex signatures - Source: [APT Scanner THOR](http://www.bsk-consulting.de/apt-scanner-thor/)
  - Much more ... (cannot update the list as fast as I include new signatures)

Loki is the new generic scanner that combines most of the features from my recently published scanners: [ReginScanner](https://github.com/Neo23x0/ReginScanner) and [SkeletonKeyScanner](https://github.com/Neo23x0/SkeletonKeyScanner).

## Requirements

No requirements if you use the compiled EXE.
If you want to build it yourself:

## Signature and IOCs

Since version 0.15 the Yara signatures reside in the sub-repository [signature-base](https://github.com/Neo23x0/signature-base). You can just download the LOKI release ZIP archive and run LOKI once to download the 'signature-base' sub repository with all the signatures. 

The IOC files for hashes and filenames are stored in the './signature-base/iocs' folder. All '.yar' files placed in the './signature-base/yara' folder will be initialized together with the rule set that is already included. Use the 'score' value to define the level of the message upon a signature match. 

You can add hash, c2 and filename IOCs by adding files to the './signature-base/iocs' subfolder. All hash IOCs and filename IOC files must be in the format used by LOKI (see the default files). The files must have the strings "hash", "filename" or "c2" in their name to get pulled during initialization.  

For Hash IOCs (divided by newline; hash type is detected automatically)
```
Hash;Description [Reference]
```

For Filename IOCs (divided by newline)
```
Filename as Regex;Description [Reference]
```

# User-Defined Scan Excludes

Since version v0.16.2 LOKI supports the definition of user-defined excludes via "excludes.cfg" in the new "./config" folder. Each line represents a regular expression thats gets applied to the full file path during the directory walk. This way you can exclude certain directories regardless of their drive name, file extensions in certain folders and all files and directories that belong to a product that is sensitive to antivirus scanning. 

The '''exclude.cfg''' looks like this:

    # Excluded directories
    #
    # - add directories you want to exclude from the scan
    # - double escape back slashes
    # - values are case-insensitive
    # - remember to use back slashes on Windows and slashes on Linux / Unix / OSX
    # - each line contains a regex that matches somewhere in the full path (case insensitive)
    #   e.g.:
    #   Regex: \\System32\\
    #   Matches C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe
    #
    #   Regex: /var/log/[^/]+\.log
    #   Matches: /var/log/test.log
    #   Not Matches: /var/log/test.gz
    #
    
    # Useful examples
    \\Ntfrs\\
    \\Ntds\\
    \\EDB[^\.]+\.log
    Sysvol\\Staging\\Nntfrs_cmp
    \\System Volume Information\\DFSR

# Threat Intel Receivers

Since version v0.10 LOKI includes various threat intel receivers using the public APIs of these services to retrieve and store the IOCs in a format that LOKI understands. It is no problem if these indicators overlap with the ones already included. Loki uses a filename regex or hash only once. (no preformance impact)

The threat intel receivers have also been moved to the [signature-base](https://github.com/Neo23x0/signature-base) sub repository with version 0.15 and can be found in "./signature-base/threatintel".   

Provide your API key via ```-k APIKEY``` or set it in the script header.  

## Open Threat Exchange (OTX) Receiver

It's a simple script that downloads your subscribed events/iocs from [Alienvault OTX](https://otx.alienvault.com) and stores them in the correct format in the './iocs' subfolder. The script is located in the "./threatintel" folder and is named "get-otx-iocs.py". (see requirements above)

```
usage: get-otx-iocs.py [-h] [-k APIKEY] [-o dir] [--verifycert] [--debug]

OTX IOC Receiver

optional arguments:
  -h, --help    show this help message and exit
  -k APIKEY     OTX API key
  -o dir        Output directory
  --verifycert  Verify the server certificate
  --debug       Debug output
```

## MISP Receiver

A simple script that downloads your subscribed events/iocs from a custom [MISP](https://github.com/MISP/MISP) instance and stores them in the correct format in the './iocs' subfolder. YARA rules stored in MISP will be written to the './iocs/yara' subfolder and automatically initialized during startup. The script is located in the "./threatintel" folder and is named "get-misp-iocs.py". (see requirements above)

```
usage: get-misp-iocs.py [-h] [-u URL] [-k APIKEY] [-l tframe] [-o dir]
                        [-y yara-dir] [--verifycert] [--debug]

MISP IOC Receiver

optional arguments:
  -h, --help    show this help message and exit
  -u URL        MISP URL
  -k APIKEY     MISP API key
  -l tframe     Time frame (e.g. 2d, 12h - default=30d)
  -o dir        Output directory
  -y yara-dir   YARA rule output directory
  --verifycert  Verify the server certificate
  --debug       Debug output
```

# Compile the Scanner

Download PyInstaller [v2.1](https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller/releases/tag/v2.1), switch to the pyinstaller program directory and execute:

    python ./pyinstaller.py -F C:\path\to\loki.py

This will create a `loki.exe` in the subfolder `./loki/dist`.

## Pro Tip (optional)

To include the msvcr100.dll to improve the target os compatibility change the line in the file `./loki/loki.spec` that contains `a.bianries,` to the following:

    a.binaries + [('msvcr100.dll', 'C:\Windows\System32\msvcr100.dll', 'BINARY')],
    
# Use LOKI on Mac OS X

- ```brew install yara```
- Also install the requirements: ```sudo pip install yara-python``` and colorama, gitpython, netaddr, pylzma, psutil
- cd loki folder, sudo python loki.py -p /

# Antivirus - False Positives

The compiled scanner may be detected by antivirus engines. This is caused by the fact that the scanner is a compiled python script that implement some file system and process scanning features that are also used in compiled malware code.

If you don't trust the compiled executable, please compile it yourself.
